### Issues so far:
```dbt seed```

- ```column_types:``` can only recogonize the first column
        **output:** ```{the second column} does not match the name of any column in this table```

- How to customize ```DATE``` format from **dbt**? It can only ingest YYYY-MM-DD at this moment

- Perform query combining DDL and DML, looking for examples

### Notice:
do not use space in .csv. dbt/snowfalke not going to trim them
